📝 My To-Do List Project:

This is my To-Do List project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It helps to manage daily tasks like adding, marking, and deleting them easily.
I made it in a simple way so that it’s easy to understand and learn from.

💡 How to Use:

1) Open the file index.html in any browser.
2) You will see a box in the middle with a title “To-Do List” and an input bar.
3) Type any task in the input box and click the Add button.
4) Your task will appear below with a checkbox and a delete button.
5) You can tick the checkbox ✅ if your task is done.
6) You can press the Delete button 🗑️ to remove a task.


✨ Extra Things I Added: 

1) Used localStorage so tasks don’t disappear after refresh.
2) Added a beautiful sky blue header for a clean look.
3) Used a blur glass effect in the background.
4) Made smooth hover effects for buttons and task items.
5) Simple checkbox to mark tasks as done.
6) Neat and user-friendly layout.

🛠️ What I Used:

1) HTML → to make the structure of the To-Do List.
2) CSS → to design the look, colors, and layout.
3) JavaScript → to make everything work (add, delete, mark done, save data).

📘 What I Learned: 

While making this project, I learned how to:

1) Use localStorage to save data on the browser.
2) Create and update elements using JavaScript.
3) Make beautiful UI using CSS gradients and blur effects.
4) Write clean and simple code that’s easy to understand.

📄 Note:

1) I made this project in a simple and easy way.
2) All functions and variable names are written in my own style so that anyone can read and understand them easily.
3) It’s a small project, but it helped me learn a lot about how web apps actually work.
